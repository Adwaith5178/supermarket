 Dynamic Pricing System in Supermarket Retail

 Project Description
 
This project is an automated retail solution designed to optimize supermarket revenue and minimize  wastage through a data-driven pricing engine.
Unlike traditional static pricing, this system analyzes real-time inventory levels, product shelf-life, and demand patterns to adjust prices dynamically.
The system features a Dual Login Portal for Administrators and Customers. Admins gain access to financial analytics and inventory clearance tools, while customers experience 
a responsive interface with real-time price updates. The core logic utilizes Python-based processing to calculate optimal price points, 
which are then synchronized across a full-stack MERN application.

 Technologies Used

The project is built using a modern full-stack architecture to ensure scalability and real-time performance:

Frontend: React.js (for a responsive, component-based user interface).

Backend: Node.js & Express.js (handling API routing and server-side logic).

Database: MongoDB (NoSQL database for flexible product and transaction storage).

Automation: Node-cron (for scheduled automated price updates).

Security: Bcrypt for password hashing.

Real-time Updates: Optimized data flow (React → Node → ML → Mongo) to ensure instant UI synchronization.
